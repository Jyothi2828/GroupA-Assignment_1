Sample Persona :
Sudha is a senior auditor who checks houses and buildings to make sure they are safe and follow the rules.She carefully records all her findings in a note-taking app,but its hard to organise because the app only handles text and not pictures, which are crucial for her audit work.Besides her audits, Sudha also has to report to her most senior audit managers and manage her meeting schedule.She carries her laptop to every site but often misses meetings because of her busy audit work.The app she uses doesnâ€™t show reminders and to do lists frequently,so she forgets her meetings and important tasks.Sudha needs a better way to remember her meetings and stay productive.
This is why incorporating Evernote into her company software could really help he with the accuracy and efficiency she needs.With Evernote Sudha can spend less time dealing with written work and more time focusing on making sure houses and building are following the rules.Evernotes ability to handle pictures and provide frequent reminders and to-do lists would help Sudha to stay organised.
